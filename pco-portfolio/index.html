      <h1>Why ICT fits me</h1>

      <p>
        ICT suits me because it combines problem-solving with creativity. I enjoy looking at a complex
        issue, breaking it down into smaller steps, and building a structured solution. At the same time,
        I like that ICT leaves room for experimenting and coming up with original ideas — it's not just
        about following instructions but also about finding new approaches. In my past work as a game tester,
        I learned to spot small issues and think critically about how systems behave. That same mindset is
        useful in programming: being able to track down where something goes wrong and fixing it step by
        step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another reason is the direct impact. ICT skills are used everywhere: from the apps we use daily
        to the systems that keep businesses running. Knowing that what I learn here can be applied to real
        projects and make a difference motivates me. It means that the effort I put into studying pays off
        in a visible way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, this study suits me because it keeps me challenged. I know I will have to stay consistent
        with my time and effort to keep up. That pressure motivates me to improve my discipline, and I
        like the idea that every finished project is proof of growth. ICT matches not only my interests
        but also the personal skills I want to strengthen for the future.
      </p>
