        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Mikołaj Makulski and I'm a first-year HBO-ICT student. I've always been curious about
          how technology works and how new developments like AI, blockchain, or quantum processors can
          change the world. After a break since high school, I'm excited to challenge myself again, return
          to coding, and eventually combine my passion for technology with practical skills.
        </p>

          In my free time I enjoy gaming, travelling (I've visited more than 30 countries), and spending
          time with friends outdoors. Snowboarding, skateboarding, and going to the gym help me stay
          active, while cooking and music give me ways to relax. I'm open to working both independently
          and in teams: I like helping others, but I also value the deep focus I can reach when working
          solo. My friends would probably describe me as loyal, funny, and smart, while I see myself as an
          open-minded problem solver who enjoys challenges.
